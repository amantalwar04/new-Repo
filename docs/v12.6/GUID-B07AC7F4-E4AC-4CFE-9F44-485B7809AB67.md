# Fast MSS DDR Memory Simulation

Libero SoC v12.6 introduces a Fast Mode simulation model for the MSS DDR. The fast mode model bypasses the DDR initialization sequence to speed up simulation.

The model also includes a QoS feature to tune the bandwidth for the fabric hosts when accessing DDR.

For more information, see the *PolarFire SoC MSS simulation User Guide*.
