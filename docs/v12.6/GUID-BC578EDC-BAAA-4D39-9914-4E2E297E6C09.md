# MPFS250 FCVG484 – Bank1 and Bank9 Common Voltage DRC

In the MPFS250-FCVG484 package, there is no VDDI for Bank9. Instead, this package supports VDDI on Bank1 as in the case of the FCVG484 package for the PolarFire SoC Icicle kit.

A Design Rule Check \(DRC\) has been implemented in Libero SoC v12.6 to check for this restriction.

For more information check the PPAT file for each package.
