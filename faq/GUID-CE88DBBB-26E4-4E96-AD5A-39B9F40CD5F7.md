# Software Installation

## Can I install the Libero SoC service packs to get the complete software installation?

The Libero SoC service packs are add-on installations to the Libero SoC base version. Ensure that the base version is installed first and then update it with the service pack.

To use Libero SoC v11.7SP1, Libero SoC v11.7 must be installed prior to SP1 installation.

## Can Libero SoC be installed in any drive or folder?

Yes, you can install Libero SoC in any drive or folder. Ensure that the path used for each installation is unique. However, it is recommended to install the same inside a folder \(on any drive\) and not directly in a drive.

E:\\ should not be directly used as the installation directory, rather E:\\<some\_folder\>\\ should be used as the installation path.

## How can I uninstall the Libero SoC software?

Run the Libero SoC uninstaller from the Microsemi Libero start menu group or from the Windows control panel, add/remove software utility. If this does not work, and the Libero SoC software is not uninstalled, then contact [Microsemi Technical Support](mailto:SoC_Tech@microsemi.com).

## Can I have more than one version of Libero SoC installed on the same computer?

Yes, you can install different versions of Libero SoC on the same computer. However, you must install each version in a different folder.

## The Libero SoC Installer closes before the installation is complete. What can I do?

Contact [Microsemi Technical Support](mailto:SoC_Tech@microsemi.com) for debugging assistance on this issue. Following is the list of possible causes:

-   A corrupted/incomplete downloaded Libero SoC installer.
-   A conflict caused by the security software actively running and accessing files also being used during the Libero SoC installation process.
-   Insufficient user privileges to complete the installation.
-   A corrupted Windows registry.

## Does Microsemi provide a silent installer for Libero SoC?

Yes, Microsemi provides silent installation support. All installers \(Libero, program Debug and MSS\) have provision to be installed silently. See [Libero SoC Documentation](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc#documents) for more information.

## Do I need administrative privileges to install Libero SoC?

Yes, you must have administrative privileges to install Libero SoC, and for the first launch of Libero SoC.
