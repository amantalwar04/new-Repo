# PolarFire PCN20027 Maximum Read Frequency on Certain LSRAM Read Modes Have Been Reduced

The following PolarFire LSRAM configurations have derated Fmax specifications.

Users who use one of the following LSRAM configurations with a design that runs faster than the new limits listed in the following table should upgrade to Libero v12.6 and re-run static timing using SmartTime.
