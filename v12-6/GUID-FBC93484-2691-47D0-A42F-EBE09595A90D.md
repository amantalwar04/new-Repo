# PolarFire SoC Security Policy Manager Option to Disable eNVM Field Updates

Using this option, eNVM can be pass key protected for field updates. By default, field updates are allowed for eNVM without requiring FlashLock Passcode \(UPK1\). To protect eNVM, select the option to disable erase/write operations, which requires FlashLock Passcode \(UPK1\) to be able to update eNVM.
